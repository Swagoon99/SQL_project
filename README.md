# COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL

**Author:** Frederick Adigun  

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data using SQL to uncover insights into infection, mortality, and vaccination trends.  
It focuses on identifying fatality and incidence rates, tracking vaccination progress, and comparing global and regional outcomes, with special attention to Nigeria.

Key tasks included:
- Calculating fatality and incidence percentages.  
- Ranking countries and continents by mortality and infection rates.  
- Aggregating global case and death counts over time.  
- Using joins, CTEs, temp tables, and views to compare vaccination coverage versus population.

The analysis highlights variations in global impact and vaccination progress, and provides a foundation for further visualization in Power BI or Tableau.
